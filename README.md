# OmarStartKit Warehouse Module Enhancement Documentation

## Project Overview Analysis

### Current Architecture Assessment

#### Shared Module Foundation
The OmarStartKit project follows a robust Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture with modular structure. The Shared module provides essential foundational components:

**Key Shared Components:**
- **Company Model**: Multi-company support with settings, branches, and hierarchical structure
- **CompanyBranch Model**: Multi-branch support with location, type, and primary branch designation
- **User, City, Country Models**: Geographic and user management foundation
- **Modular Service Provider**: Auto-discovery and registration system

**Shared Module Strengths:**
1. ✅ Multi-company architecture ready
2. ✅ Multi-branch support implemented
3. ✅ Geographic location handling (countries, cities)
4. ✅ Settings management system
5. ✅ Soft deletes and audit trails

#### Current Warehouse Module Status
**Existing Implementation:**
- Basic WarehouseModel with business/branch relationships
- Location and contact information
- Manager assignment and capacity tracking
- Temperature control and security level support
- Operating hours and status management

**Current Limitations:**
- ❌ No product management system
- ❌ No inventory tracking
- ❌ No IMPA/SKU/Barcode support
- ❌ No expiry date management
- ❌ No serial number tracking
- ❌ Limited warehouse types

## Enhanced Warehouse Module Requirements

    'issue' => 'Stock Issue',
    'transfer' => 'Inter-warehouse Transfer',
    'adjustment' => 'Stock Adjustment',
    'return' => 'Return to Vendor',
    'scrap' => 'Scrap/Disposal',
    'cycle_count' => 'Cycle Count',
